**Setting up the backend**

Make sure you create a [Firebase Project](https://firebase.google.com/). After your project is ready, go to your Github profile and create a Github OAuth app, you can follow the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app) for setting a Oauth app.  

After you are done setting up the backend please read the [Workflow](https://github.com/listentothefrog/reviewurcode/blob/dev/WORKFLOWS.md) so that you can understand the logic that we are using in the backend.
